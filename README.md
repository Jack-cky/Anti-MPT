### Background
- The Hong Kong Chief Executive, John Lee Ka-Chiu, has a plan to acquire more global talents to strengthen Hong Kong's expertise in leading fields of innovation and technology. ([source](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/sections-news-print/245175/HK-lagging-in-global-talent-scramble))
- Currently, there are several schemes for foreigners to apply for a work permit (visa) in Hong Kong, including General Employment Policy, Mainland Talents and Professionals, Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, and Technology Talent Admission Scheme.
- We believe this would be interesting to understand the current talent recruitment while watching, with packs of peanuts, how Mr Lee will "spare no effort" to attract skilled people to land in Hong Kong.

### Data Source
The figures on visa applications are available in the [Hong Kong Immigration Department](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/facts/visa-control.html). As it is published officially, data is assumed to be accurate and error-free. Data processing is done in Excel scraping (no-code development).

---
### Implication
- Over the past 4 years, only 308 IT talents applied for a visa through the Technology Talent Admission Scheme. There was a drop in applications in 2021 due to the COVID situation.
- More than one-third of talents only received their bachelor's degree, which is not a qualification that is enough for developing the Innovation and Technology Centre.
- The majority of talents came from the same place, China. It showed that the scheme is not attractive for immigrants, or might not be designed for global talents.
